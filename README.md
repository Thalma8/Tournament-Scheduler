# Tournament-Scheduler
The project will develop a round robin tournament schedule at the users’ prompts. Optionally, the application can be used to keep score. The problem of scheduling a tournament in which all participants compete against each other one-on-one in a series of rounds probably goes back to pre-history. This project presents a thoughtful resolution of the problem and some software implementations that seek to explore various ways to look at it from a programmer’s view. For instance, to plan a tournament for 12 players; Everyone gets teamed with everyone else one time. Everyone plays against a team having everyone else on it twice. In combinatoric literature this is a Whist tournament.
